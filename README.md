## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/Jsifontez/random-quote-machine/blob/main/public/random-quote-machine.png)

Hi :wave: the most hardness of this challenge was the call of the API. That because the API had changed of version and his documentation was deprecated.

Reading throught the api code, I learned that the only thing that I have to do was change the version in the URL fetch. __So, remember do a good research instead of giving up__ :rocket:

- Improved my logical thinking
- Improved [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/api/motion/) knowledge
